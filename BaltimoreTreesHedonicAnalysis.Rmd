## Tree Cover, Race, and House Prices in Baltimore, Maryland

This data analysis explores the variables predicting 2010 sale prices of 
townhome and single family homes in Baltimore, Maryland. 

Given that Baltimore neighborhoods are highly racially segregated, this analysis sought to determine if there is an interaction between the effects of census block group racial composition and tree canopy cover on home price. Our null hypothesis was that canopy cover contributes similarly to home sale price in neighborhoods with contrasting racial compositions.

```{r set workspace, echo=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/LabUser/Documents/Side_projects/BaltimoreTrees/Baltimore_Trees_R_Scripts")
```

We collected ecological and socioeconomic data from various sources. We obtained
LiDAR-derived canopy cover data at 30-m resolution for 2011 from https://daac.ornl.gov/CMS/guides/CMS_Maryland_AGB_Canopy.html (Dubayah et al. 2018). We interpolated a mean parcel canopy cover value for each property using bilinear interpolation (taking the mean of the 4 nearest cell centers). Given the 30-m resolution, this provides an estimate of canopy cover for tree cover on the home's property, as well as properties directly adjacent (immediate neighbors).

We obtained home sale price data from the State of Maryland Department of Planning (https://planning.maryland.gov/Pages/OurProducts/downloadFiles.aspx), and joined these data with more detailed home date (number of baths, square footage etc.) from the private property data management company SpecPrint (http://www.specprint.com/).

We obtained spatial data on parks, major roads, and other features from state and federal databases, and obtained block group-level census data as American Community Survey estimates (2013) from American FactFinder (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). We obtained neighborhood-level indices of property and violent crime from https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Crime-Safety-2010-2014-Shape/bywi-mtiu 

The full suite of predictor variables include:

* Canopy Cover (CanCovPerc) 
* lnAcres (Natural log of property acreage)
* YrBuilt (Year Built)
* lnSqFt (Natural log of home square feet)
* Bath (Number of bathrooms)
* Condition (Factor: Poor, Fair, Average, Good, Excellent)
* HousingType (Factor: Single family vs. Townhome)
* Viol11 (Neighborhood violent crime index 2011)
* DistDT (Distance to Downtown Baltimore)
* DistRoad (Distance to major roads) 
* DistParks (Distance to parks and arboretums)
* PercHS (Percent high school graduates (Block Group))
* lnMedHHInc (Median Household Income (Block Group))
* PercOwnOcc (Percent owner-occupied homes (Block Group)) 
* MedAge (Median age (Block Group))
* PercB (percent African American (Block Group-level))
* PercW (percent white (Block Group-level))

apply(home_sale_factor, 2, table)

# I ultimately left Sale Season out of the analysis because it was not
# significant in any models.

# Potential issue: If we use ZipName as a random effect, it may be 
# problematic to have a Zip with only 1 sale (Catonsville)

# Let's look at collinearity between variables to identify potentially
# important/problematic correlations.

home_sale_numeric2 <- subset(home_sale, select = -c(SaleSeason, Condition, HousingType, ZipName, Price, Acres, SqFt, MedHHInc
                                                   ))

# How to read this correlation plot: Blue indicates positive correlation, red
# indicates negative correlation. The narrower the elipses, the stronger the
# correlation.
```

Looking at the correlation matrix and plot, it's clear that Baltimore is highly 
segregated due to the very high negative correlation between percent black and
percent white in Census block groups. We'll proceed with the analysis using just
one of these variables, percent black. Other potentially problematic high correlations between variables include crime indices Prop11 and Viol11, which makes sense. There seems to be almost no correlation between property crimes and home price, so I'm going to proceed only using violent crime. LnAcres and DistDT are highly correlated (0.74), so I'm going to keep an eye on the Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) for these variables.

## Fit multiple linear regression models

Our modeling strategy had four main components:

1. Initially, we fit a multiple linear regression model to predict lnPrice from the main effects Canopy Cover (CanCovPerc) and percent African American (Block Group-level) (PercB), in addition to the following control variables:

* lnAcres (Natural log of property acreage); and square of lnAcres
* YrBuilt (Year Built); and square of YrBuilt
* lnSqFt (Natural log of home square feet)
* Bath (Number of bathrooms)
* Condition (Factor: Poor, Fair, Average, Good, Excellent)
* HousingType (Factor: Single family vs. Townhome)
* Viol11 (Neighborhood violent crime index 2011)
* DistDT (Distance to Downtown Baltimore)
* DistRoad (Distance to major roads) 
* DistParks (Distance to parks and arboretums)
* PercHS (Percent high school graduates (Block Group))
* lnMedHHInc (Median Household Income (Block Group))
* PercOwnOcc (Percent owner-occupied homes (Block Group)) 
* MedAge (Median age (Block Group))

This initial model did not include any variable interactions. We evaluated whether the model met assumptions and tested for residual spatial autocorrelation.

2. Upon detecting significant residual spatial autocorrelation, we fit a random effects model with random intercepts based on ZipName (Zip code). Exploratory analyses indicated higher sale prices in some Zip Codes than others. We again tested for residual spatial autocorrelation.

3. Upon detecting no significant residual spatial autocorrelation in the mixed effects model, we tested  the performance of a model including an interaction between Canopy Cover (CanCovPerc) and percentage black residents in a census block group (PercB). In addition to evaluating whether this interaction was significant, we also compared model performance to the model without interactions based on minimizing RMSE.

4. For all models, we tested model performance by fitting the models on 75% of the dataframe (the training set) and predicting the remaining 25% (the test set).

## Test for Spatial Autocorrelation

# at the semivariogram

# summary(home_model_nlme)

# Import data as a spatial dataframe (spdf)

home_sale_sp <- home_sale
coordinates(home_sale_sp) <- ~Lon+Lat
# home_sale_sp

homeCRS <- CRS("+proj=longlat +init=epsg:4269")

proj4string(home_sale_sp) <- CRS("+proj=longlat +init=epsg:4269")

# plot(home_sale_sp, pch = 16)

# str(home_sale_sp)

# summary(home_sale_sp$residuals)

# semivariogram

semivario1 <- Variogram(home_model_nlme, form = ~Lon+Lat, resType = "normalized")
plot(semivario1, smooth = TRUE)

# Doesn't really look like there's a lag based on the semivariogram

### Moran's I: Calculate Euclidean distance matrix ###

# I initially had an error here but I figured out the problem. I needed to jitter my lat/lon locations by a tiny bit for those few Townhomes that have virtually identical Lat/Lon coordinates in order to compute a distance matrix. I did this in the CSV file by adding radomly generated numbers to the end decimal place.

geo <- cbind(home_sale$Lon, home_sale$Lat)
dist_mat <- as.matrix(dist(geo)) # Euclidean distance
# dist_mat_inv <- 1/dist_mat # inverse distance matrix
# diag(dist_mat_inv) <- 0
# summary(dist_mat_inv)
Moran.I(residuals(home_model_nlme), dist_mat, alternative = "two.sided")
```

The Moran's I test indicates significant residual spatial autocorrelation (SAC) (p < 0.05), despite the unsuspicious variogram. Let's fit a mixed effects model to try and account for the residual SAC.

## Linear Mixed-Effects Model

```{r}

# Linear mixed-effects model

                        + DistDT + DistRoad + DistParks + PercHS + lnMedHHInc 
                        + PercOwnOcc + MedAge + PercB, random = ~1|ZipName, 
                        method = "ML",  data = home_sale)

printCoefmat(summary(home_model_random1)$tTable)

# Checking assumptions.
plot(home_model_random1)
qqnorm(residuals(home_model_random1, type = "normalized"))
abline(0,1, col = "red", lty = 2)

# plot the semivariogram
semivario2 <- Variogram(home_model_random1, form = ~Lon+Lat, resType = "normalized")
plot(semivario2, smooth = TRUE)

# Test residual SAC with Moran's I
Moran.I(residuals(home_model_random1), dist_mat, alternative = "two.sided")
# p > 0.05, so no residual spatial autocorrelation. Great! Now let's test interactions.

# Note: While I have written code for evaluating these mixed effects models  
# (i.e. fitting on 75% of the data, testing on 25%; checking further 
# assumptions), those code chunks are omitted here for brevity, and with the 
# recognition that these models may change depending on feedback.

```

This interaction plot shows that higher canopy cover is associated with higher home sale price, and that the slope of this effect is relatively consistent between neighborhoods with a low proportion of black residents, mean proportion of black residents, and a high proportion of black residents. This is consistent with our null hypothesis that the positive relationship between canopy cover and home sale price does not vary by the racial composition of Baltimore neighborhoods.

The mixed-effects model and the interaction plot indicate no significant interaction between the effects of canopy cover and violent crime levels on home prices (i.e., higher canopy cover is associated with higher home sale value in safe neighborhoods as well as high-violent-crime neighborhoods).

This interaction is not related to canopy cover, but it is an important interaction impacting sale price. Home sale prices are lower in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of black residents in general, but even moreso for neighborhoods with high rates of violent crime.

## Comparing Models

# Compare mixed effects models via AIC and log likelihood.
anova(home_model_random1, home_model_random2, home_model_random3, home_model_random4)

Model 4, which incorporates the interaction between violent crime and proportion black residents, performs the best, and has higher explanatory power than the models including interactions between race, crime, and canopy cover.

# Findings (thus far)

Our analyses demonstrate that higher canopy cover is associated with 
higher sale prices of homes sold in the city of Baltimore in 2010, regardless of the racial composition of the block group a home is located in.

This means that buyers in both predominantly white and predominantly black
neighborhoods percieve value in urban tree canopy. Given that there is wide 
variation in the levels of canopy cover across Baltimore neighborhoods, there are opportunities to enhance home values in all neighborhood types through tree planting and urban greening. These findings may also contribute to critical discussions of green gentrification.
